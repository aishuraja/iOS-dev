**Main Objectuve:**

This repository serves as my learning journey into iOS mobile development. It contains several small, one-page projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts and techniques in iOS development. As I continue to expand my skills, I plan to build more complex, data-driven applications and integrate larger projects into this repository. This will allow me to showcase my progress and explore advanced topics such as persistent data storage, networking, and performance optimization.

**Completed Projects:**

These are the completed projects that demonstrate various aspects of iOS development, ranging basic one-page apps to CoreML functionalities. Each project reflects key concepts I’ve learned and applied, showcasing my growing proficiency in building iOS applications.

  - WeSplit : A checksplit iOS application [ Avoid any awkward math at the end of your meal! ]
  - GuessTheFlag : A small game to guess the countries flag [I’ve personally developed the ability to identify various country flags]
  - BetterRest : An application to predict your ideal sleep time. [ Trust me , I am using it]
